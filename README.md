# AKEYRA
The first 100% open source ortholineal ergonomic mechanical keyboard

There is no good reason to keep the traditional keyboard layout: we can make better keyboards.

A rectangular form factor is not necessary for keyboards: a 100% full-sized keyboard will most likely stay home. 

A big value or a visual interface is not having to depend on your memory, but rather on your visual/muscular memory.

AKEYRA gives you all a keyboard can give.
